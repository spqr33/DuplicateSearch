General purpose of the program is a searching of duplicates of files.
Program has NOT any warranties, and you can/should/must/may use it AS IS.

You can use this long or oneletter options:
--help                                  produce help message
--search-path | -p                      Start finding here
--label | -l                            Set label
--save-duplicates-to | -S               Path to XML file.
--save-errors-to | -E                   Path to errors XML file


The program traverses recursively directory tree, starts from --search--path.
For each file the program calculates MD5 hash (I use OpenSSL library to do it).
You can implement AbstractHash and use your own hash function.
If read or access to a file/ directory error occurs,
it is saved to --save-errors-to file (default is dublicate_search_error.xml).

The --label option will allow to idetify file later.

Program use two boost library, and OpenSSL:
*) boost::program_options - Parsing command line arguments.
**) boost::serialization - Serialization class state(Pointers, all STL containers,
shared_ptr, polymorphic pointers, arrays, etc.) to archive(text, binary, XML).
program uses XML.
***) as said above, it used for hash calculating.
Therefore these libraries must be installed.
